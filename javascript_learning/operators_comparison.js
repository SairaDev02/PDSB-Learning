//TODO JS Operator & Comparison

//? Operators in JS

let a = 8;
let b = 2;

a += 2; //addition
b -= 2; //subtraction
a *= 2; //multiplication
b /= 2; //division
a %= 2; //modulus (division remainder)
b **= 2; //exponention
a++; //increment
b--; //decrement

//? Comparison in JS

a == b; //equal to
a === b; //equal to in value and type
a != b; //not equal
a !== b; //not equal value and type
a > b; //greater than
a < b; //less than
a >= b; //greater than and equal to
a <= b; //less than and equal to
let val = (a > b) ? a : b; 
    //if condition is true, return a
    //else return b

//? String addition

let text1 = "Jon";
let text2 = "Tron";
let text3 = text1 + "The" + text2;

//? JS Logical operators

//* && (logical and)
//* || (logical or)
