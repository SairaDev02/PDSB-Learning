//TODO JS data types

//? JS 8 datatypes

//* Numbers:
let length = 16;
let weight = 7.5;

//* Strings:
let color = "Yellow";
let lastName = "Johnson";

//* Booleans
let x = true;
let y = false;

//* Object:
const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"};

//* Array object:
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

//* Date object:
const date = new Date("2022-03-25");

//? Dynamic datatype

let xx; //x is undefined
xx = 5; //x is a number
xx = "XX" //x is a string

//? Exponential notation

let xy = 123e5; //12300000
let yx = 123e-5; //0.00123

//? JS BigInt

//* Used to store integer values that are too big to be represented normally

let xBig = BigInt("1234567891234567891234567890");

//? JS Arrays

const carBrands = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"]; //index starts from 0

//? JS Objects

const Person = {firstName:"Jon", lastName:"Tron"} //written as name:value pairs

//? JS Empty values

let areas = " "; //Value is " ", typeof is string
